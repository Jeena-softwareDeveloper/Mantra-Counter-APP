# Mantra-Counter-APP
# Mantra Counter App

A simple and intuitive **Mantra Counter** mobile application built using **React Native**. This app allows users to count mantra repetitions, set a target for repetitions, and receive notifications upon reaching the target. The count and target persist even after closing the app, thanks to **AsyncStorage**.

## Features

- **Increment Mantra Count**: Users can manually increment the count for each mantra repetition.
- **Set Target**: Users can set a target for the number of mantra repetitions (e.g., 108 repetitions).
- **Target Notification**: The app notifies users through vibration when the target is reached.
- **Reset Counter**: Allows users to reset the counter to zero with a single button press.
- **Data Persistence**: Mantra count and target are stored using AsyncStorage, ensuring persistence even after the app is closed or reopened.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: A user-friendly interface with large buttons for ease of use.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development.
- **AsyncStorage**: For persisting counter and target data locally.
- **Vibration API**: Used to notify the user when the mantra repetition target is achieved.
